Dataset design
==============

In this part of the documentation you will find the dataset specification, starting with a brief overview of :doc:`Xarray <xarray:index>` on which the Quantify dataset is based on, and examples of datasets that comply with that specification. Along with that, you will also find some information on the design choices and know limitations.
